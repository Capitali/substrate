# build-app.sh — assemble (and sign) Familiar.app from a release build.
#
# Produces dist/Familiar.app, a menu-bar accessory bundle whose entry point is the marble.
# All four binaries live in Contents/MacOS together, so the marble's sibling-resolution finds
# the Glass, the familiar daemon, and the familiar-eye camera helper inside the bundle — and,
# crucially, the macOS camera grant (TCC) attaches to *this bundle's* identity rather than to
# whatever terminal launched a build.
#
# Signing: pass a Developer ID Application identity as $APP_IDENTITY for a stable,
# notarizable signature; otherwise it falls back to an ad-hoc signature ("-"), which is fine
# for running locally but gives the bundle a new identity on each rebuild (so the camera grant
# must be re-approved after a rebuild — see packaging/README.md). Either way the bundle is
# signed with the hardened runtime + camera entitlement, so the same artifact is what gets
# notarized once a real identity is supplied.
