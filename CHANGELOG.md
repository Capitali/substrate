# Changelog

All notable changes to Substrate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches 1.0. The chronological
engineering detail lives in [`docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`](docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md);
this file is the human-readable summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Repository as scientific evidence** — FAIR/FAIR4RS + IMRaD structure: root
  metadata (`CITATION.cff`, `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`), the
  `docs/00`–`07` IMRaD set, Architecture Decision Records (`docs/decision-records/`), and the
  `experiments/`, `validation/`, `security/`, `data/` evidence trees.
- **CI** — `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test` on push/PR.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-24 — Genesis + telos-first bootstrap

### Added
- **Genesis** — the constitution (`docs/SOUL.md`): the Three Laws as root, with the
  whole design derived downward from them. Founding vision carried forward as
  `docs/seed.txt`.
- **Brick 0** — Cargo workspace (`crates/kernel` + `crates/cli`), Rust, with
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; `store.rs` JSONL persistence over `serde`.
- **Brick 1** — the observation spine: the `Observation` record (the only truth)
  and `substrate observe` / `observations`.
- **Brick 2** — the **service signal (Law I)**: `service_signal()` measures
  served-facing attention from observations; `substrate service` reports it.

### Context
- Re-founds the archived bottom-up predecessor `Capitali/factory` (tag `v1-final`),
  inverting the order of derivation: purpose is the floor, evolution the method on
  top of it. See [docs/01-problem-statement.md](docs/01-problem-statement.md).
