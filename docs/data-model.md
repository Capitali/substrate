# Data Model

The conceptual model of what Substrate stores and how the records relate. The
operational format and schema are in [`../data/`](../data/); this is the *meaning*.

## The one truth: observations

Everything begins with the **observation** — a `actor · action · object` triple plus
provenance (`source`, `ts`, `confidence`, optional `context`). The observation log
is therefore a **triple store**, and it is the *only* authoritative record. Every
other record is **derived** from observations and can be discarded and rebuilt. This
is what lets derived views churn freely without ever drifting from what was actually
observed.

Current schema: [`../data/schema/observation.schema.json`](../data/schema/observation.schema.json).

## Derived & lifecycle records (porting with the kernel)

These existed in v1 and port in subordinate to the law-signals. Listed here so the
full model is visible even before the code lands:

| Record | Is | Derived/relates to |
|---|---|---|
| **Loop** | a recurring `actor·action·object` pattern | grouped observations (temporal view) |
| **Candidate** | a response to a loop | `loop_id`, `parent_id` (lineage), hypothesis, traits |
| **Trial** | a test of a candidate | `candidate_id`, scenario, scores, failure class |
| **Pattern memory** | a lesson from trial history | positive/negative evidence across candidates |
| **Lineage** | ancestry of a candidate | the `parent_id` chain |
| **Service / Presence signal** | Law I / Law II measures | computed from observations (and later loops/trials) |
| **Guard record** | a Law III decision | allow / seek-consent / refuse + rationale, attached to an action |

## Invariants the model must hold

- Observations are append-only and authoritative; derived records never feed back as
  truth.
- A candidate child has a `parent_id`; a mutation records its `changed_traits`.
- The genotype/phenotype (Weismann) barrier: somatic state never edits heritable DNA.
