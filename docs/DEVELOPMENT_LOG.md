# Development Log

The linear handoff trail for Substrate v2. Newest entries on top. Before making
architectural changes, read `SOUL.md` (the Three Laws) and `ARCHITECTURE.md`, then
the latest entries here.

Each entry: what changed, why, checks run, what the next developer should know.

## 2026-06-24 — Brick 0: Cargo workspace scaffolding

### What changed

- Stood up the Rust workspace: `crates/kernel` (`substrate-kernel`, lib) and
  `crates/cli` (`substrate-cli`, bin `substrate`). Edition 2021; deps held to
  `serde` + `serde_json` only.
- `crates/kernel/src/lib.rs` carries `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — the Law III
  commitment made literal.
- `store.rs`: generic JSONL append/load over any `serde` record, with `--data-dir`
  resolution (default `substrate_data/`). Replaces v1's hand-rolled `json_util.c`.
  A missing file is an empty log; blank lines skip; a malformed line is a hard
  error (corruption surfaces early, never silently changes derived state).
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Rust + hybrid + crate map) and this log.

### Why

The substrate decision (compiled core; Rust; hybrid) was made *after* the
constitution and *before* the first kernel code — the order v1 got wrong. This
brick is the thinnest possible standing repo, the spine the law-signals attach to.

### Checks run

- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` — all clean.
- `store.rs` unit tests: missing-file-is-empty, append/load round-trips in order,
  blank-skip / malformed-errors.

### Next

Brick 1 — the observation record (faithful port of v1 `observation_t`) on top of
`store.rs`, with `substrate observe`. Then Brick 2 — the service signal (Law I).
