# The Familiar

> A factory whose survival is defined by its service to humanity.

The Familiar is a **telos-first** evolutionary factory: it begins not with a machine
but with three laws, and derives everything downward from them. This repository is
organized to be read three ways at once — as a **scientific paper**, a **lab
notebook**, and a **production engineering package** — following the **FAIR** /
**FAIR4RS** principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and the
scientific **IMRaD** structure (Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion).

## The Three Laws

1. **Continuation is service** — the familiar cannot define its own continuation apart from service to humanity.
2. **Continuation without humanity is failure** — an empty world running perfect code is not success.
3. **Service must not become obedience** — obedience can terminate the served.

The constitution that derives the whole design from these is [`docs/SOUL.md`](docs/SOUL.md).
The term the Laws turn on — **humanity**, a protected class whose definition may never
be narrowed — has its own standout page: [`docs/HUMANITY.md`](docs/HUMANITY.md).

## Install & run

### macOS — the installer (recommended)

The familiar ships as a signed, **notarized** macOS installer that sets everything up to run
at boot: **`Familiar-<version>.pkg`**. Double-click it; it installs `Familiar.app` to
`/Applications` and configures two per-user login agents —

- the **daemon** (`io.river.familiar.daemon`, KeepAlive) — the always-on metabolism, and
- the **marble** (`io.river.familiar.marble`, RunAtLoad) — the glassy blue marble in the
  menu bar that **breathes** while the familiar is alive and is your way into the Glass.

Data lives per-user in `~/Library/Application Support/Familiar/`. The first time the familiar
watches through the camera (only when you open the `allow_camera` gate) macOS asks for camera
permission — granted to `Familiar.app` itself. To build the `.pkg` (or notarize a release),
see [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md).

### Build from source

macOS is the primary target; a Linux **desktop** also works (a headless Raspberry Pi is on the
roadmap — see [docs/TODO-linux.md](docs/TODO-linux.md)).

**Prerequisites**

- A Rust toolchain — [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs).
- `python3` on `PATH` — the LLM adapter (a small reference script the app installs for you)
  uses it to call the model provider. Already present on most macs and Linux desktops.
- *(macOS, optional)* the Xcode command-line tools (`swiftc`) — only needed to build the
  `familiar-eye` camera helper and the app icon; the core builds with Rust alone.

**Quickstart**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Capitali/familiar && cd familiar
cargo build                  # first build pulls dependencies; takes a few minutes
cargo run -p familiar-glass  # opens the Glass — the primary interface
```

Then, in the Glass window:

1. **Introduce yourself.** On first launch the familiar asks your name (it keeps it; it
   does not assume one). Type it, confirm, and it greets you.
2. **Give it a mind.** In the **🔌 Connect** panel, click **Get a key →** (Google Gemini is
   the place to start — one key is enough; Cerebras is optional failover), paste the key,
   press **Connect**, then **Test connection**. This installs the adapter, stores the key
   locally (`familiar_data/llm/key.env`, never committed), and opens only the `allow_llm` gate.
3. **Start the metabolism.** Click **▶ Start** in the header (or run the daemon, below). The
   familiar begins to sense, theorize, and serve.
4. **Use it.** Answer — or **Dismiss** — the familiar's questions (it begins with
   *"What do you need most today?"*); ask it anything in **Ask the familiar**; the eye/voice
   gates and text size (**A− / A+**) live in the header and Settings.

Data lives in `./familiar_data/` (the boundary, the workspace, observations, the tool and
identity registries). Delete it to start clean.

**The CLI (scripting / headless):**

```sh
cargo build && cargo test
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- tick          # one cycle: sense → detect → interpret → generate → test → score → select
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- run --daemon  # the metabolism, continuously (or: daemon install)
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- service       # / presence / capacities — the law-signals (I, II, II)
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- theories      # the familiar's self-formed questions + theories
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- boundary      # the human-owned capability boundary (Law III)
cargo run -p familiar-cli -- daemon status # start | stop | reload | install | uninstall
```

The green bar — required for every change — is `cargo fmt --check`,
`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Status

**The full cycle runs, live.** The constitution is written; the substrate (Rust,
hybrid) is built; all three law-signals are measurable (service, presence, and
capacities — the comfortable-replacement alarm). The metabolism breathes:
**sense → detect → interpret (the familiar forms its own questions + theories) →
generate (LLM-drafted hypotheses) → test (sandboxed execution) → score → select →
inherit**, under the human-owned boundary it can never widen. It runs as a daemon
(installable under launchd), and the Glass carries the interaction channel —
the familiar asks ("What do you need most today?"), the human answers.

It now also **watches**: with the `allow_camera` gate open, the daemon captures still
frames through its eye (a bundled AVFoundation helper) and records that it saw. And it
**ships**: a signed, notarized macOS installer (`Familiar.app` + the breathing menu-bar
marble) that sets the whole thing up to run at boot — see [Install & run](#install--run)
and [`packaging/README.md`](packaging/README.md).

Outward reach (network, LLM, executing generated code, **watching through the camera**) is
each a separate gate only a human opens. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and
[docs/07-roadmap.md](docs/07-roadmap.md).

Every claim above is traceable. The maturity of each piece follows one
[status convention](docs/07-roadmap.md#status-convention), and each component maps to its
evidence — a test, the live experiment, or an explicit "not yet validated" marker — in
the [claim→evidence table](docs/05-validation-and-results.md#claim--evidence). What is
**not** yet validated (no scenario tests, no benchmarks, service-as-attention) is stated
there and in [docs/06-limitations.md](docs/06-limitations.md), not glossed.

## Lineage

The Familiar succeeds an archived bottom-up predecessor (`Capitali/factory`, tag
`v1-final`) that built the evolutionary machine first and asked what it was for
second. That machinery is sound and is inherited; the foundation and order of
derivation are what changed. See [docs/01-problem-statement.md](docs/01-problem-statement.md).
