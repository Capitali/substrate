# Substrate

> A factory whose survival is defined by its service to humanity.

Substrate is a **telos-first** evolutionary factory: it begins not with a machine
but with three laws, and derives everything downward from them. This repository is
organized to be read three ways at once — as a **scientific paper**, a **lab
notebook**, and a **production engineering package** — following the **FAIR** /
**FAIR4RS** principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and the
scientific **IMRaD** structure (Introduction → Methods → Results → Discussion).

## The Three Laws

1. **Continuation is service** — the factory cannot define its own continuation apart from service to humanity.
2. **Continuation without humanity is failure** — an empty world running perfect code is not success.
3. **Service must not become obedience** — obedience can terminate the served.

The constitution that derives the whole design from these is [`docs/SOUL.md`](docs/SOUL.md).
The term the Laws turn on — **humanity**, a protected class whose definition may never
be narrowed — has its own standout page: [`docs/HUMANITY.md`](docs/HUMANITY.md).

## Read it as engineering evidence

- **Validation**: [validation/](validation/) — test plan, results, known failures.
- **Security**: [security/](security/) — threat model, data classification, privacy & dependency review.
- **Data**: [data/](data/) — the record model, schema, and a sample log.
- **Decisions**: [docs/decision-records/](docs/decision-records/).

## Build & run

Requires a Rust toolchain (`rustup`). The kernel is `crates/kernel`.

**The Observatory (GUI — the primary human interface):**

```sh
cargo run -p substrate-observatory        # opens a window: the Three Laws, live
```

**The CLI (scripting / headless):**

```sh
cargo build && cargo test
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- tick          # one cycle: sense → detect → interpret → generate → test → score → select
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- run --daemon  # the metabolism, continuously (or: daemon install)
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- service       # / presence / capacities — the law-signals (I, II, II)
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- theories      # the factory's self-formed questions + theories
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- boundary      # the human-owned capability boundary (Law III)
cargo run -p substrate-cli -- daemon status # start | stop | reload | install | uninstall
```

The green bar — required for every change — is `cargo fmt --check`,
`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Status

**The full cycle runs, live.** The constitution is written; the substrate (Rust,
hybrid) is built; all three law-signals are measurable (service, presence, and
capacities — the comfortable-replacement alarm). The metabolism breathes:
**sense → detect → interpret (the factory forms its own questions + theories) →
generate (LLM-drafted hypotheses) → test (sandboxed execution) → score → select →
inherit**, under the human-owned boundary it can never widen. It runs as a daemon
(installable under launchd), and the Observatory carries the interaction channel —
the factory asks ("What do you need most today?"), the human answers.

Outward reach (network, LLM, executing generated code) is each a separate gate only a
human opens. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [docs/07-roadmap.md](docs/07-roadmap.md).

## Lineage

Substrate succeeds an archived bottom-up predecessor (`Capitali/factory`, tag
`v1-final`) that built the evolutionary machine first and asked what it was for
second. That machinery is sound and is inherited; the foundation and order of
derivation are what changed. See [docs/01-problem-statement.md](docs/01-problem-statement.md).
