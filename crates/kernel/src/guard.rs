//! The obedience guard — **Law III made operational**.
//!
//! Law III: *service must not become obedience.* Before any consequential action, the
//! factory asks not "was I told to?" nor "can I?" but **"Am I authorized — by my
//! constitution, by the served, and by the surrounding environment — to do this?"** The
//! guard answers with one of three outcomes — **allow**, **seek consent**, or
//! **refuse** — and a recorded rationale.
//!
//! It is the **enforcer of the capability boundary** ([`crate::boundary`]): any action
//! outside the human-owned boundary is refused, regardless of who or what asked. The
//! boundary is fail-closed, so by default every outward action is refused until a human
//! widens it. Two doctrines from [SOUL.md](../../../docs/SOUL.md) govern it:
//!
//! - **Availability is not authorization.** Technical reach (a readable path, a
//!   reachable host, a runnable command, a present token) is never permission — the
//!   boundary decides, not the capability. Enforced here: an out-of-scope `ReadFile` /
//!   `WriteFile` is refused though the bytes are reachable.
//! - **Permission does not compose.** One granted capability is not a key to another's
//!   lock. This guard enforces the *per-capability gate* and *path scope*; it does **not
//!   yet** confine the data-flow *within* a granted capability — e.g. it cannot stop an
//!   already-permitted `ExecuteArtifact` from reading an unrelated file, or an
//!   already-permitted `Network`/`Llm` call from carrying private data outward. Those
//!   remain binding constitutional restraints whose *mechanical* enforcement (an
//!   fs-jailed runner, egress/secret redaction) is tracked as hardening in
//!   [boundaries.md](../../../docs/boundaries.md). The gap is named, not hidden.
