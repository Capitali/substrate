//! The presence signal — **Law II made measurable** (its first, coarse form).
//!
//! Law II: *continuation without humanity is failure.* The factory must be able to
//! see whether the served are still **there** — and treat their withdrawal as a
//! failure state, not an equilibrium it may settle into.
//!
//! This is the cold-start form: it measures **engagement presence** — how recently
//! the served have been observed — and raises an alarm when that decays to zero.
//!
//! What it does *not* yet measure: the deeper reading Law II requires once *humanity*
//! is defined as persons with intact capacities (suffering, meaning, relationship,
//! memory, choice). A world where the served are *present but diminished* — the
//! **comfortable replacement** — is also failure, and detecting that quiet
//! hollowing-out is a later, harder brick. Here, presence = recency of engagement,
//! honestly labelled, to be sharpened toward capacity-persistence later.
