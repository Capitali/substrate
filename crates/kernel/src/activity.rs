//! The activity log — a per-tick record of what the metabolism did, so the human can
//! *see* the familiar working. The Glass renders it as a feed and a signals-over-time
//! chart; before this existed, the familiar's actions (theorize, pursue, test, promote)
//! were printed only to `daemon.log` and were invisible in the Glass.
//!
//! Append-only JSONL, derived/rebuildable — not truth. It lives in the kernel (not the
//! cycle) so the Glass, which depends on the kernel and not the cycle, can read it.
