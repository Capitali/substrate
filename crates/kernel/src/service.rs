//! The service signal — **Law I made measurable**.
//!
//! Law I: *continuation is service.* The factory cannot justify its own
//! continuation apart from service to humanity, so it must be able to *see*
//! whether it is serving. This module is the first, honest version of that sight.
//!
//! It is deliberately v1-simple — the way v1's drives started on promotion-rate
//! before redundancy. With only observations to read (loops, candidates, and
//! trials port in later bricks), it measures **served-facing attention**: how much
//! of what the factory observes concerns the humans it exists to serve. That is
//! the cold-start *proxy* for service, not service rendered; later bricks fold in
//! whether observed needs are actually being reduced.
