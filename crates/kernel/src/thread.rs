//! Thread — a question the factory poses and a theory it holds.
//!
//! The **Interpret** step of the cycle made durable: as the factory observes, it
//! forms questions (to ask the human) and theories (about what the patterns mean).
//! These are *not* observations — observations are the only truth, of the world;
//! a thread is the factory reasoning *about* that truth. A minimal port of v1's
//! richer `thread_t` (fitness/decay/lineage come later).
