//! Substrate kernel — the deterministic core.
//!
//! This crate is the *compiled, deterministic kernel* of the hybrid architecture
//! (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`): records, persistence, and the signals that make
//! the Three Laws (`docs/SOUL.md`) measurable. Behavior evolves in the periphery,
//! not here — so this core changes rarely and is held to a hard discipline.
//!
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is the **Law III** commitment made literal: a
//! long-running autonomous process with unrestricted local and network reach must
//! not contain the memory-unsafety that would let it be turned against the served.
