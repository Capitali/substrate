//! The question coordination — where the familiar decides *what to ask, and when*.
//!
//! The familiar does not fire questions at the human as it thinks of them. It keeps a
//! registry of everything it might ask — the origin-story root ("What do you need most
//! today?"), questions it forms from its theories, and clarifications it needs to complete
//! an observation or make a decision — and surfaces **one at a time**, chosen by a policy.
//!
//! A dismissed question is **never thrown away**. Dismissal is data: it grows the question's
//! rest period (so the familiar doesn't nag) and is recorded with its context (the seed of
//! later understanding *why* it was dismissed). The root question recurs whenever the policy
//! judges the moment right — weighing how often it's been dismissed, unmet human needs, and
//! the familiar's own need to know. Append-only JSONL; a rewrite updates a question's stats.
