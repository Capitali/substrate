//! The metabolism — one tick of the factory cycle.
//!
//! `Observe → Name → Generate → … → Return`, in the honest form available today:
//!
//! 1. **Sense** the host (perception; deduped by triple so static facts don't spam
//!    the log — only genuinely new facts are recorded). Connectivity is the one
//!    outward bit, gated by the caller. A **structural fingerprint** of the perceived
//!    triples is taken here; [`TickReport::quiet`] reports whether the world (and the
//!    factory's own work) stood still, which the daemon uses to pace itself — fast when
//!    the environment changes, drowsy when it doesn't (adaptive cadence).
//! 2. **Detect** loops over all observations.
//! 3. **Generate** a gen-0 candidate for any loop not yet covered.
//! 4. **Measure** the law-signals (service, presence).
//! 5. **Return** a report of what changed.
//!
//! Not yet in the loop (honest gaps): *test → score → select* await scenarios and
//! artifact execution; *LLM-assisted* hypothesis drafting awaits a gated, off-by-
//! default consult. Candidate generation is deterministic for now. The cycle never
//! reaches outward except the (gated) connectivity probe.
