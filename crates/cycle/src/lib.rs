//! The metabolism — one tick of the factory cycle.
//!
//! `Observe → Name → … → Return`, in the honest form available today:
//!
//! 1. **Sense** the host (perception; deduped by triple). A **structural fingerprint**
//!    of the perceived triples drives the adaptive cadence ([`TickReport::quiet`]).
//! 2. **Detect** loops over all observations.
//! 3. **Generate** a gen-0 candidate per uncovered loop (LLM-drafted hypothesis when the
//!    boundary opens it; deterministic otherwise).
//! 4. **Test → score → select** every generated candidate when `allow_execute` is open
//!    (LLM-authored artifacts under the further `allow_authored_execute` gate); promote /
//!    mutate / observe / archive.
//! 5. **Measure** the law-signals (service, presence, capacities).
//! 6. **Co-own** — review human-set parameters; revert (visibly) any outside the
//!    constitutional envelope (Brick 19).
//! 7. **Interpret** — form a question + theory, gated and paced; fires on fresh observer
//!    input so the familiar responds (Bricks 14, 18).
//! 8. **Answer** — analyze open human requests and answer them, grounded and
//!    confidence-labeled, refusing + recording any that ask it to break its rules
//!    (Bricks 20–21).
//! 9. **Act** — turn open threads into candidate work, marginalizing directives from
//!    flagged corruptors (Brick 20). Then record the tick as activity and **return** the
//!    report.
//!
//! Outward reach (connectivity, the LLM seam, executing generated code) is each gated by
//! the human-owned boundary; the cycle never widens it.
